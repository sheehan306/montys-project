					<h3>Delivery</h3>
					<div class="text"><h3>Countries we ship to?</h3><br>We are both proud of and committed to our vast international audience and ship to every country in the world.
					 We are based in the UK and all our orders will be shipped from the UK, however we are able to provide fast, cheap
					 and efficient international deliveries.<br><br><h3>How soon will it be shipped?</h3> <br>Due to the wide range of products we sell and the various customisation 
					 options we offer, there is no single answer to this question, so we will do our best to explain the different scenarios, 
					 while you are of course welcome to contact us for an exact delivery quote on a specific product.The majority of our items
					 are in stock and if they require no shirt printing or other customisation, will ship the next working day if ordered before
					 2pm. This is the scenario in most cases, as we generally hold all items in stock.From time to time, items will be on backorder
					 for various reasons such as delayed deliveries from suppliers or temporary stock shortages. In these circumstances, stock is
					 generally received in approximately 7-10 working days, at which point it will be shipped immediately to you. If you have an 
					 existing order, please check your order history within your account, where further information about the current status will be given. 
					 If you are looking to place a new order, you are welcome to contact us to clarify the delivery terms. <br><br><h3>How long will shipping take?</h3> <br>
					 After the item has been shipped, we are unable to control the shipment times, however the following timescales are a good general guide. UK shipments are
					  generally received within 1-2 days, although the majority arrive next day. EU shipments are generally received within 10-14 days. While it can sometimes
					   take longer and you should not panic if it exceeds these timescales, many shipments are received in as little as 3-5 days.International Shipments are 
					   generally received within 2-3 weeks. While it can sometimes take longer and you should not panic if it exceeds these timescales, many shipments to our
					    most popular destinations such as USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and parts of Asia are received in 1 week or less. </div>
